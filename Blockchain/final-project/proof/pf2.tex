Suppose we have a set $A$ of $n$ users from Twitter, and a set $B$ of $m$ users
in Bitcoin, we can come up estimate of the probability $P(a_i, b_j)$ of user $a_i \in A$ in
Twitter having public key $b_j \in B$ in Bitcoin, assuming there is a one-to-one
mapping between the two sets. \\

\textbf{Proof:}\\


Let $A$ be the set of Twitter Users, such that $|A| = n$. Let $a \in A$.\\

Let $B$ be the set of Bitcoin Public Keys, such that $|B| = m$. Let $b \in B$\\
Suppose $m>n$.\\

We want to find $P(a,b)$, the probability of user $a$ having the public key $b$,
where
\begin{align*}
  P(a,b) &= \frac{\text{The number of mappings where $f(a) = b$}}{\text{Total number of mappings}}
\end{align*}

Let $F(A, B) = \{ f: A\rightarrow B \text{ such that f is an injection}\}$. \\

We know that $|F(A,B)| = {m\choose n}\cdot n! = \frac{m!}{(m-n)!} $.\\

If we fix $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a)=b$,\\

then let $F(A', B') = \{f': A' \rightarrow B' | A' = A - \{ a\}, B' = B - \{ b\}\}$. \\

Since $|A-\{a\}| = m - 1$ and $|B-\{b\}| = n - 1$, then $|F(A', B')| =
{m-1\choose n-1}\cdot (n-1)! = \frac{(m-1)!}{(m-n)!}$.\\
 


 So,
 \begin{align*}
   P(a,b) &= \frac{\text{The number of mappings where $f(a) = b$}}{\text{Total number of mappings}}\\
          &= \frac{|F(A', B')|}{|F(A,B)|}\\
          &= \frac{(m-1)!}{(m-n)!}/\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}\\
          &= \frac{(m-1)!}{m!}\\
            &= \frac{1}{m}
  \end{align*}

  Assuming there is a one-to-one mapping between set the Twitter users in set
  $A$ and the Bitcoin users in set $B$, then the probability of a Twitter user
  $a$ having the public key $b$ is $P(a,b) = \frac{1}{m}$.
